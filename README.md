# RiskFightingGame
Simulates a fight between two opposing teams - like the board game Risk.

One team is the attacking team, the other defends.

The defending team can roll up to two dice while the attacking team can roll three. The defending team can roll dice equal to the number of soldiers it has. Meanwhile, the attacking team needs at least 2 soliders to roll one dice (can't attack with 1 soldier). 

If the defending team's dice is equal or greater to the attacker's highest die, the attacker loses a soldier. If the attacker's dice rolls are all greater than the defender's, the defender loses the amount of soldiers it rolled dice with.
